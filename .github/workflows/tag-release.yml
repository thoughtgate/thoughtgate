# Tag Release
#
# Automatically creates a git tag and dispatches the Release workflow
# when a release PR merges to main.
#
# Flow:
#   1. Release PR (from prepare-release.yml) merges to main
#   2. This workflow creates an annotated git tag (format: v0.4.0)
#   3. Dispatches release.yml via workflow_dispatch (no PAT needed)
#   4. cargo-dist builds binaries and creates the GitHub Release
#
# No extra secrets required — GITHUB_TOKEN can trigger workflow_dispatch.
