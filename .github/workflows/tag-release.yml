# Tag Release
#
# Automatically creates a git tag and dispatches the Release workflow
# when a release PR merges to main.
#
# Flow:
#   1. Release PR (from prepare-release.yml) merges to main
#   2. This workflow creates an annotated git tag (format: v0.4.0)
#   3. Dispatches release.yml via workflow_dispatch
#   4. cargo-dist builds binaries with SLSA provenance attestation
#
# Security model:
#   - The PR merge (signed by the developer) is the authorization gate
#   - The tag is an automation artifact, not a trust anchor
#   - SLSA provenance on release artifacts provides verifiable integrity
#   - Tag ruleset should restrict v* creation to this workflow + maintainers
